SSD2805-MIPI Master Bridge Chip
Features
Support up to 700Mbps over 2 data lanes (350Mbps per lane)
Reduce number of signals to 8 lines over the serial link (DATAP0, DATAN0, DATAP1, DATAN1, CLKP, CLKN, MIPI_RES# and SYS_CLK)
Reduce power consumption and decrease EMI by using low amplitude signal over differential pair for serial data.
